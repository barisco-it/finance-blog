# Taxonomy Model – SadeFinans

This blog follows a minimal surface structure with a controlled tag-based backbone.

We do NOT use visible categories in navigation.
Structure lives through carefully limited tags.

---

## Core Principles

- Tags are visible under each article.
- Maximum 3 tags per article.
- Total active tags limited to 8–10.
- No micro-tags (e.g. "altın", "dolar", "fon").
- Tags represent concepts, not assets.

## Tag Usage Rules

- Every article must have at least 1 tag.
- Maximum 3 tags.
- Tags must reflect core concept, not minor mentions.
- Avoid adding new tags unless absolutely necessary.
- New tag addition requires explicit justification.

---

## What We Avoid

- Asset-specific tags (altin, dolar, fon, hisse).
- Time-specific tags (2025, kriz).
- Emotional tags (zenginlik, özgürlük).
- Trend-based tags (kripto hype).

---

## Long-Term Scalability

If tag count exceeds 12:

- Review taxonomy.
- Merge overlapping tags.
- Do NOT allow uncontrolled expansion.

Simplicity is strategic.
